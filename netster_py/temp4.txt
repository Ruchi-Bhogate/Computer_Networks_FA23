Test for SMPT Task 2
The purpose of this assignment is to extend the netster file-transfer behavior so that it supports reliable network communication over UDP. We call this Reliable UDP or RUDP. You already implemented an application protocol over TCP and UDP and you will now have an opportunity to test your existing code over an unreliable network. Once the limitations of UDP over an unreliable channel become clear you should feel motivated to solve the issue at hand with your own RUDP implementation.

This assignment requires both careful planning and likely several iterations of your design before it meets the specifications put forth in the tasks below. You will have more time to complete this assignment, but be sure to start early and begin experimenting with a lossy network to understand how things work. Good luck!
